            Visual Hierarchy

            <p> Visual hierarchy is the order in which humans process information on a page. It’s a system to
                prioritize elements so that they are easily understood. Without a visual hierarchy or design structure,
                users can be overwhelmed and as a result, fail to take anything in. That’s why it’s important to organize
                elements in a way the human eye can make sense of them.

            <p>            Color contrast refers to the difference in luminance between text and background elements. 

                It is best to use high-contrast colors for text and background of websites, which  will ensure that the text will stand out and is easy to read. Low contrast colors will make it difficult to differentiate between the background and the text..     
                
                Contrasting colors examples include pairings like black and white or purple and yellow. These colors contrast each other and are easy for viewers to see and differentiate between. 
                
                Why is Color Contrast Important?
                Color contrast is important because text and background colors can determine how people interact with the content that is written in those colors. Low contrast colors are difficult to read when text contrasts poorly with background colors, while high-contrast colors are easier to read when paired together.

            White Space

            <p>           White space commonly refers to negative space—the unmarked area around and within visual web design elements such as imagery, logos and text. The following exemplify different types of white space: 


                Wide margins on a page
                
                Spaces between text blocks and those between each letter (also known as kerning in typography)
                
                The negative space within or around images
